<h1>My Favorite Anime</h1>

<hr />
<h2>The Promised Neverland (Season 1)</h2>
<p>Beautiful art style and I love thrillers. Only Season 1 because Season 2 was a mess.</p>
<h2>Violet Evergarden</h2>
<p>Probably the most visually gorgeous anime I've seen. Violet's character development is *chef's kiss*.</p>
<h2>Spy X Family</h2>
<p>Laughed so hard I nearly cried. Hilarious and creative use of dramatic irony.</p>
